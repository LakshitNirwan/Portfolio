        <p>
          I am a motivated and enthusiastic individual with a strong interest in
          technology and creative problem-solving. I enjoy learning new skills,
          exploring modern tools, and applying my knowledge to real-world
          projects. This portfolio represents my academic journey, personal
          interests, and continuous growth as I refine my technical and creative
          abilities.

      <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond academics, I actively explore hobbies that help me express my
        creativity and keep my curiosity alive. I enjoy trying out new things,
        learning from different experiences, and pushing myself to grow both
        personally and creatively. These interests allow me to relax, think
        differently, and often inspire new ideas that I carry into my technical
        and academic work.
